<h1 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h1>
<p>You are expected to complete your own work in this class. Cheating on exams or lab exercises is not fair to students who are studying honestly. Cheating is also subject to penalties, which can include getting a zero for the assignment or failing the course. The full list of possible penalties is listed in the CSN Student Academic Integrity Policy. Please make yourself familiar with this policy (<a href="https://at.csn.edu/documents/student-academic-integrity-policy">https://at.csn.edu/documents/student-academic-integrity-policy</a>).</p>
<h2 id="stay-out-of-trouble-by-following-these-rules">Stay out of trouble by following these rules:</h2>
<h3 id="rule-1-you-must-not-look-at-solutions-or-program-codes-that-are-not-your-own."><strong>Rule 1: You must not look at solutions or program codes that are not your own.</strong></h3>
<p>
It is an act of plagiarism to submit work that is copied or derived from the work of others and submitted as your own. For example, using a solution from the Internet or a solution from another student (past or present) or some other source, in part or in whole, that is not your own work is a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy. Many infractions I see make use of solution code found online. The best way to steer clear of this possibility is not to search for online solutions to the programming assignments. Moreover, looking at someone else’s solution code in order to determine how to solve the problem yourself is also an infraction of the Academic Integrity Policy. In essence, you should not be looking at someone else’s code in order to solve the problems in this class. This is not an appropriate way to “check your work,” “get a hint,” or “see alternative approaches.”
</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-you-must-not-share-your-solution-code-with-other-students."><strong>Rule 2: You must not share your solution code with other students.</strong></h3>
<p>
In particular, you should not ask anyone to give you a copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who asks you for it. Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic strategies to such an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning in the same code. Moreover, you are expected to take reasonable measures to maintain the privacy of your solutions. For example, you should not leave copies of your work on public computers nor post your solution code on websites.
</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-you-must-indicate-on-your-submission-any-assistance-you-received."><strong>Rule 3: You must indicate on your submission any assistance you received.</strong></h3>
<p>If you received aid while producing your solution, you should indicate from whom you got help and what help you received. A proper citation should specifically identify the source (e.g., person’s name, book title, website URL, etc.) and a clear indication of how this assistance influenced your work (be as specific as possible). For example, you might write “I discussed the approach used for sorting numbers in the <code>sort\_numbers</code> function with TA Mary Smith.” If you make use of such assistance without giving proper credit, you may be guilty of plagiarism.</p>
<p>It is also important to make sure that the assistance you receive consists of general advice that does not cross the boundary into having someone else write the actual code or show you their code. It is fine to discuss ideas and strategies, but you should be careful to write your programs on your own, as indicated in Rules 1 and 2.</p>
<p>I have no desire to create a climate in which students feel as if they are under suspicion. The entire point of the Academic Integrity Policy is that we all benefit from working in an atmosphere of mutual trust. Students who deliberately take advantage of that trust, however, poison that atmosphere for everyone. I only ask that you be up front and transparent. If you use a Web resource**, just cite the exact source(s). This becomes part of the formal documentation for your program and a ready reference for yourself in the future:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co">/// The mathematical constant PI with 15 digits.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co">/// </span><span class="an">@see</span><span class="co"> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="at">const</span> <span class="dt">double</span> PI = <span class="fl">3.14159265358979</span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="rule-4-beware-of-using-artificial-intelligence-resources"><strong>Rule 4: Beware of using Artificial Intelligence Resources</strong></h3>
<p>I am aware of A.I tools such as, but not limited to, ChatGPT. Please refrain from using A.I. tools to complete assignments and to assist on quizzes or exams. My main objective is to prepare students for fruitful careers within the field of computer science. Although A.I. has a place and use, while in the process of learning you should only use it as a reference, not as a leader to write code for you.</p>
<p>Just be transparent, please. Sneaky behavior destroys trust really quickly.</p>
